# Design Decisions

We use GitHub for our code and files
GitHub is a widely used solution within Common Ground, and as an open-source project it offers us enough functionality to run our project openly and for free

All design decisions are recorded i this document. This also means all final decision that did *not* lead to user stories are recorded here to avoid resubmission.
