## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What is Common Gateway

The Common Gateway is a further Dutch development of the European API Platform. API Platform is a project of [Les Tilleus](https://les-tilleuls.coop/en/technologies/api-platform) and, in itself, an extension of the Symfony framework. API Platform is a tool for delivering APIs based on standardized documentation and is used for various French and German government projects. Including [Digital state](https://digitalstate.io/), a precursor to Xroute, [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/) and Common Ground. The project is now part of [joinup.eu](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/) (the European equivalent of Common Ground).

Benefits of API Platform include:

- Format independent (supported to JSON also JSON-HAL, JSON-LD, GraphQL, and XML as exchange formats
- Symfony shares a (PHP) codebase with WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and Magento.
- Based on generation from external definitions
- Frequently used project
- Support for packages and plug-ins and therefore easily extensible.

The Dutch extension is currently managed by Sim Groep, Procura, Excellence, and Conduction. The Dutch extension is under the same EUPL license as the original API Platform. Benefits of the extension include:

- Integration of Dutch components such as DigiD, eHerkenning, logging and processing, NLX, NL API Strategy, Notifications and NL Design System.
- a stand-alone store for plug-ins and adapters based on Public Code (the European standard for software exchange)
- Optimization (Entire dataset queries under a second)
- Integration for Camunda

The Common Gateway was made possible with contributions from Utrecht, 's-Hertogenbosch, Buren, BISC, Hoorn, SED and Almere

## Open Source

As a project, we believe in open source and open community. We consciously choose to run our project openly and honestly. In addition to the code, all user stories and the roadmap are publicly accessible. We ask government officials and suppliers to note this and contribute actively.

## Pitch in

Governments and suppliers can contribute to this project in several ways:

- *Actively contribute to discussions*. All discussions of this project are held in the [discussion page](/orgs/CommonGateway/discussions). Everyone is free to start a discussion or participate, but the Product Owner makes the final decision together with the Steering Committee. Final decisions that do not lead to user stories are recorded in the [DESIGN.md](/CommonGateway/.github/blob/main/DESIGN.md).
- *Participate in the Steering Committee*. The Steering Committee meets every two weeks and determines the [roadmap](/orgs/CommonGateway/projects/1/views/1) of the project. In principle, all authorities and suppliers can participate in the Steering Committee, but the final decision on participation lies with the Product Owner. If you are interested in participating in the Steering Committee, you can contact ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
- *Submission of feature requests*. Anyone can submit a feature request, you do not need to be a member of the Steering Committee or have development capacity. Feature requests are discussed by the Steering Committee that determines whether and where they will appear on the [roadmap](/orgs/CommonGateway/projects/1/views/1). Suppliers may ask for an explanation or an estimate of hours.
- *Contribution of code*. Each party is free to submit code to the project through a pull request. Please note that submitting code does not automatically lead to acceptance. Read the [Contributing](/CommonGateway/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for a description of the delivery process and associated requirements.

## Roadmap

This project follows a public roadmap, which you can find under the corresponding board. No rights can be derived from the roadmap as it functions as an indication only. The product owner determines the roadmap in consultation with the Steering Committee. Parties that have good ideas about the roadmap are asked to submit them. See [‚ÄúContributions‚Äù](/CommonGateway/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
